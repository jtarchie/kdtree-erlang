WARNING: This is my real first attempt at writing Erlang. Use at your own risk, but any feedback is welcome.

This is a KD Tree implementation written in Erlang. It supports the building of the kdtree and finding the nearest neighbor of a specific point. It is designed to support multi-dimensional points, but for right now has only been tested against 2d data sets.
